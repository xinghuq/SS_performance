# SS_performance

## This is the depository to store files and scripts on Qin,X., Gaggiotti,OE. 2021. Information-based summary statistics for spatial demography inference. In preparation.

## Depository contains five folders: Simulations, KLFDA, Randomforest, Deep Neural Network, and t-sne. 
"Simulations" contains the pipeline simulating the demographic scenarios and calculating the summary statistics.

Other folders are the corresponding scripts of testing the performance of 9 subsets of summary statistics and scripts for making figures (5 scenarios, detailed description is shown in Qin et al, 2019).  

Parameter tuning using expend grid search and control via leave-one-out cross validation.

Users can reproduce the results with the same seeds.
